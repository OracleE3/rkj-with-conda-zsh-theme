# rkj-with-conda-zsh-theme

A "fork" of the [RKJ ZSH theme](https://github.com/ohmyzsh/ohmyzsh/blob/master/themes/rkj.zsh-theme) that adds conda env indication and git status stolen from [simplerich-zsh-theme](https://github.com/philip82148/simplerich-zsh-theme/blob/main/simplerich.zsh-theme)

```zsh
┌─[user@hostname] - [(base)] - [<path>] - [2024-03-27 10:04:01]
└─[0] 
```
